--- === mj.screen ===
---
--- Manipulate screens (i.e. monitors).
---
--- You usually get a screen through a window (see `mj.window.screen`). But you can get screens by themselves through this module, albeit not in any defined/useful order.
---
--- Hydra's coordinate system assumes a grid that is the union of every screen's rect (see `mj.screen.fullframe`).
---
--- Every window's position (i.e. `topleft`) and size are relative to this grid, and they're usually within the grid. A window that's semi-offscreen only intersects the grid.
